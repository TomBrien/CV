## About
This repo hosts my CV, its existence is essentially to allow me to play around with automating the population of my CV and build with [Travis-CI](https://www.travis-ci.org). I also deploy the built PDF to the [releases](https://github.com/TomBrien/CV/releases) of this repo so if you are interested in me, feel free to take a look.
Currently, this may not be the most up to date version as I build the backend, please contact me should you require a definitive version.
